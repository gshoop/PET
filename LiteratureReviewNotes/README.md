# $\beta ^+ \gamma$ Principles
When certain radioactive isotopes decay we see $\beta ^+$ emission in the form of a positron $e^+$. After a short amount of time usually in picoseconds the positron will annihilate with collinear photons carrying some energy (511 keV). This is the key principle behind Positron Emission Tomography (PET) which aims to detect the annihilation photon pairs and localizing the point of positron emission. There are some radioactive isotopes, such as $^{44}Sc$, which in addition to $\beta ^+$ decay there is an additional emission of $\gamma$ radiation from the point of decay that carries some energy (1156 keV). For most PET detectors, it is a struggle to properly detect radiation with energy greater than 1.1 MeV. A detector system called a Compton Camera takes advantantage of compton scattering of high energy radiation and aims to create a detector system that has two points of detection where the first stage intends to see a compton scattering event for the higher energy $\gamma$ radiation and then the second stage will detect the lower energy scattered photon. This third detection of a photon allows a PET-Compton detector system greater localize the radioactive tracer.
