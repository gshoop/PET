# $\beta ^+ \gamma$ Principles
When certain radioactive isotopes decay we see $\beta ^+$ emission in the form of a positron $e^+$. After a short amount of time usually in picoseconds the positron will annihilate with collinear photons carrying some energy (511 keV). This is the key principle behind Positron Emission Tomography (PET) which aims to detect the annihilation photon pairs and localizing the point of positron emission. There are some radioactive isotopes, such as $^{44}Sc$, which in addition to $\beta ^+$ decay there is an additional emission of $\gamma$ radiation from the point of decay that carries some energy (1156 keV). For most PET detectors, it is a struggle to properly detect radiation with energy greater than 1.1 MeV. A detector system called a Compton Camera takes advantantage of compton scattering of high energy radiation and aims to create a detector system that has two points of detection where the first stage (scatterer detector) intends to induce a compton scattering event for the higher energy $\gamma$ radiation and then the second stage (absorber detector) will detect the lower energy scattered photon. This third detection of a photon allows a PET-Compton detector system greater localize the radioactive tracer.

# Small Pixel Effect
## Basics
The small pixel effect describes the issues that come with trying to get good energy resolution for pixelated semiconductor detectors. When the electrode pixels are sufficiently small the charge generation within the semiconductor can become too large to be induced on any pixel alone so charge is shared among multiple pixels.
 * Why is it a problem when the charge is shared among multiple pixels? How does this ruin energy resolution?

 # Compton Imaging

 ## Basics

 Compton camera imaging for medical imaging takes advantage of compton scattering events of high energy radiation. Compton camera's are comprised of two stages, the first is a scattering stage and the second is the asborption stage where photoabsorption occurs.
