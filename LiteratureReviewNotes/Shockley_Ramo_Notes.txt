BASICS ********************

We know that the chain in semiconductor detectors (in our case gamma-ray detectors) an electric charge is generated.
The electric charge q is generated and induces a charge Q on the electrodes of the detector.
This charge Q is induced due to the movement of charge q through the semiconductor toward each of the electrodes.
This charge is amplified and converted to an output signal for signal processing/ADC/etc.

???? The time dependent output signal of a charge sensing device can be predicted if the induced charge Q on the electrode can
	be calculated as a function of instantaneous position of the moving charge q within the device ????????????? IMPORTANT

*****************************

SHOCKLEY-RAMO THEOREM --- Q induced on an electrode is proportional to the point charge q and it's potential at instantaneous position x given the selected
				  electrode is at unit potential and all other electrodes grounded with all charges removed.
		     	    --- Current 'i' on an electrode is proportional to the charge q, it's instantaneous velocity, and electric field at instantaneous position x given the
				  selected electrode is at unit potential and all other electrodes grounded with all charges removed.

ASSUMPTIONS --- The electric field propogates instantaneously and magnetic fields are negligible.

The field needed to be calculated is independent of the moving charge 'q'.
