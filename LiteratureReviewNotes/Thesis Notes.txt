Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is in vivo imaging technique where an active chemical compound "tracer" is introduced into the subject and the PET detecting
material surrounding the subject detects the radiation emitted from that tracer.

When the radioactive material decays a "positron" is emitted and pairs up with tissue electrons to create an event where radiation will scatter from that
point.

Positronium exists for a moment when the positron pairs up with the tissue electrons and then an annihilation event occurs where photons are emitted "collinearly"
and "anti-parallel" to each other. The energy of the photon in this thesis is 5.11 keV.

Detection occurs when the pair of annihilation photons are detected by the photon detectors at the same time. Due to collinearity of the pair of electrons,
a line of response (LOR) can be extrapolated in order to localize the location of the annihilation event.

NOTE: The photons are emitted "isotropically". (isotropically refers to the fact that the photons will be not be emitted with less or more energy in one direction
than another) --- the LORs can have a wide distrubtion of angles ---

1-D projections at an angle theta, are obtained when counting the number of LORs intersecting a perpendicular line 'l=aU' as 'a' (alpha) goes from -inf to inf.
The 1-D projection is the function p.

p is a function p(S(x,y),theta,alpha).
S(x,y) is a spatial distribution in the x-y plane of the radiotracers in the subject.

Full tomographs are obtained by evaluating p for 'a' from -inf to inf and 'theta' from 0-360 deg.
The 2-D image is called a 'sinogram'.

p is called the "Radon Transform" of S(x,y) - call this transform P(theta,alpha) evaluated at a specific value of theta.

S can be extracted from P by a "filtered backprojection (FBP)"**** algorithm.

We need to consider two different types of photon interactions in PET. 1. Compton Scattering 2. Photoelectric Effect

Photoelectric Effect - The annihilation photon will be absorbed by a bound electron and this will cause the ejection and emission of a photon from the orbital
of the tissue atom. The energy of the emitted photon comes from the difference of the annihilation photon energy and the binding energy of the electron.

Compton Scattering - The collision of the annihilation photon with outer shell electrons. The electron will be recoiled along a different direction and the photon
will be scattered in another direction. The photon will impart energy to the recoiled electron carrying information.

Question - Will the detector detect both the recoil electron AND the scattered photon?

SPATIAL RESOLUTION ---

physics-level effects contributing to image resolution ---> "positron range", "annihilation photon acollinearity*****"

Positron Range---- Refers to the distance that a positron travels until it's annihilation event. This depends on the surrounding medium and the initial kinetic
energy of the positron. Positron energy can affect image resolution negatively due to it's stochastic nature.

Annihilation Photon Acollinearity---- Refers to the fact that annihilation photons due not neccessarily travel collinearly and antiparallel. Since the positron
carryies some momentum with it at the end of it's range the positronium system will have some initial total momentum. Previous findings say photon trajectories
are normally distributed with FWHM of ~0.5 deg.

Instrumentation effects---- We cannot exactly define LORs as infinitely thin lines since we are restricted by the size and shape of the detectors themselves.
(Tube of Response). Finer resolution can be obtained through smaller feature size detector elements.

Detector size in scintillation crystal photon detectors depends on the physical dimensions of the crystal.
Detector size in semiconductor photon detectors depends on the electrode patterns.

IMAGE RESOLUTION UNIFORMITY ---

There will be error introduced if the annihilation photon pairs are emitted offset from the center of the Field of View (FOV) of the detector system. These photons
will be incident on the photodetectors at oblique angles which is due to the lack of knowledge of the photon's "Depth of Interation (DOI)"***** with the photon 
detectors. This makes our tube of response larger and thus affects the image resolution.

SIGNAL TO NOISE RATION ---

Poisson Distribution*** is used to observe the probability of the number of photon interactions in a fixed time interval or "scan duration".

SNR is defined as the ratio of mu/sigma --- mu: pixel or image readion's mean (average) signal intensity. sigma: standard deviation of signal fluctuation.

**Intensity** of a PET image pixel is determined by the # of LORs passing through that pixel and how many times each of the LORs were registered during the
scan duration.

So, if an image pixel is **traversed** by 'k' LORs then we produce 'k' measured values of N, (# of photon interactions detected). Thus the pixel intensity will be 
determined by the sum of the 'k' measured values of N which are independent and Poisson distributed. Each N will have a mean, lambda, which leads to the
mean image pixel signal intensity coming from the sum of the 'k' lambda values which will call A. The signal standard deviation is the sqrt(A).

So to increase SNR we would have to perform longer PET scans to get more photon interaction numbers.
One method of increasing SNR is to maximize the PET's "photon sensitivity"**** (the fraction of radiative decays that result in a PET detected photon pair).

ENERGY RESOLUTION ---

Energy resolution refers to the detection and discarding of events that may not accurately represent the radiotracers and annihilation events.
For example, Compton Scattering could result in the detection of photons that do not have collinear LORs with the point of the original photon emission.\
"Energy Grating"**** is a technique used where we may discard photon energy measurements that are below a certain threshold since photons with Compton energy
will have less energy than annihilation photons. This will be limited by the precision of our energy measurements by the photon detectors.

The precision that photon detectors can measure energy is the "energy resolution". This is defined as the percentage of the FWHM fluctuation in energy 
measurements and the photon energy currently being measured. High energy resolution will allow us to discard compon scattering interactions which could
reduce the image quality and resolution.

TIME RESOLUTION ---

It's important to be able to detect coincident events from photon detector pairs. This will depend on the time between detection of incident photons.
"True Coincidence"*** is the term for when true annihilation photon pairs are detected.
"Electron collimation"*** is the term to the localization of the radioactive source along the LOR using time coincidence.

Our precision of time detection between annihilation photon detection is the "coincidence time resolution"**** (Typically use FWHM).

The creation of a time window where any pair detected between that time window is concidered true coincidence is called "time gating"****.
It's not unreasonable to assume that there will probably be incorrectly determined true coincidences between unrelated photon pairs if they are detected 
within the time gate. This is why good time resolution is important. *****Figure 3.7******

Time difference with a high time resolution can help aid in spacial localization of the positron emission event along the LOR by assigning higher probability
on areas along the LOR depending on detection of photons during time gates.

SCINTILLATION PHOTON DETECTORS ---

Scintillation photon detectors are made up of the scintillation crystal detector and photon to electron conversion devices such as photomultiplier tubes (PMT), 
avalanche diodes (APD), and silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). High energy photons interact with scintillation material by exciting electrons from the valence band 
of the material and subsequently the generation of visible light photons occur when electrons recombine with the holes generated.
No matter the devices, the underlying principle is that the scintillation photons should interact with the electron conversion devices by generating current 
carriers that of which are carried through voltage biased electric field inducing device structures. The signal is "photocurrent"****. Each devices structure has 
an intrinsic gain where the signal is multiplied through varies methods depending on the conversion device.

Energy measurements can be measured from the amplitude of the photocurrent signals.
Timing measurements can be measured from the timing measurements of the photocurrent signals.

"Anger logic"*** formulas of equations are used to estimate the x-y position of the interacting photons from the scintillation crystal via the coupling of scintillation 
crystal arrays coupled with PMTs or ADPs via light diffusers.

DOI positioning is found through z-coordinate information. This is done through the scintillation light decay time of different scintillators.

SEMICONDUCTOR PHOTON DETECTORS ---

Semiconductor photon detectors in contrast to scintillation photon detectors perform the high energy particle to photocurrent in one step rather than needing 
the usage of electron conversion devices. High energy radiation will excite electrons from the valence band into the material's conduction band and current 
will be carried through applied electric fields. Having properly tuned band gap materials is important to avoid the scenario where we cannot distinguish the 
signal from thermally induced leakage current.

CZT and CdTe semiconductors are wide band gap materials with band gap energy >= 1.5 eV. The high atomic number for CZT and CdTe allows for a large interaction 
cross section for annihilation photons to interact with which allows the making of smaller detectors. They also have high resistivity to leakage currents.

Energy measurements can be made from signal amplitude and time measurements can be made from time measurements of the signal.
However, semiconductor photon detectors have higher accuracy for energy measurements than scintillation photon detectors and lower accuracy for time measurements 
than scintillation photon detectors. The time measurement inaccuracy is due to semiconductor photon detector's inability to transport charge as quickly as 
the propogation of scintillation photons would be able to.

2-D position inference and DOI capabilities are achieved through discretization of the electrode contacts into pixels.


CZT MATERIAL PROPERTIES ---

FCC sub-lattice structure.
Can be grown using physical vapor deposition methods, "Bridgeman method"*****, and "traveling heater method"******
CZT has a high fraction of compton scattering photon interactions compared to the fraction of photoelectric absortpion scattering.
CZT is brittle. Soldering metal contacts with a circuit board could crack the crystal because of the weak CZT lattice bonds at the surface.

METAL-CZT JUNCTION ---

Metal-Semiconductor-Metal configurations are the most basic structures for radiation detectors. Gold or Platinum are used as ohmic contacts because they posses 
similar work functions to CZT. Thickness of the metal layer must be tuned correctly to avoid unwanted surface reconstruction or defection from high stress or 
diffusion of solder.

CZT RESISTIVITY ---

Resistivity can be affected by crystal surface preparation, internal crystal defects, and orientation of voltage bias to the crystal lattice.

Crystal Surface Preparation : The crystal surface needs to be oxidized or polished to maintain high resistivity at the crystal surface of the detector.

Voltage Bias Orientaiton : Care must be.0 taken in determining the lattice plane of the CZT crystal that makes contact with the metal. Surface planes with 
abundance of tellurium atoms can have a weak "n-type" behavior and surfaces with more cadmium atoms will have lower electric resistivity.

Internal Crystal Defects : Impurities and bulk material defects can effect elecric field uniformity through the crystal or even create conditions for unwanted 
large dark current through the bulk. IR can be used to inspect the crystal for defects.

IONIZATION ENERGY AND FANO FACTOR ---

Semiconductor photon detecters have good energy resolution since electron-hole pair generation is less of a probabilistic process than in how scintillation 
photon detectors go about generating photocurrent. We can determine with some accuracy that the loss of photoelectron energy in a collision is related to 
the ionization energy and phonon energy (****Equation 4.4****).

"Fano Factor" : denoted as F relates the instrinsic signal variance in the semiconductor to the mean number of electron-hole pairs generated (**Equations 4.5-6**). 
This factor can be used to determine energy resolution.
